We have used Random Forest Algorithm to train the model and we will be tesing the model by giving the inputs from the dataset.

# Features

1.Django-Powered Web Application: The project is built using Django, providing a robust and scalable framework for implementing the network intrusion detection system.

2.Random Forest Classifier: An algorithm to improve its accuracy and reduce overfitting. By incorporating Algorithm, the algorithm is able to better handle high-dimensional data and capture more subtle patterns in the data.

3.User-Friendly Interface: The web application features an intuitive interface where users can input network data, run predictions, and view results, similar to the visual style in the image provided.

4.Real-Time Detection: The system is designed to integrate with real-time network monitoring tools, offering immediate analysis and detection of potential threats

# Getting Started

1.Clone the repository:[https://github.com/Chethanvirat/Prediction-of-Migraines]

2.Set up the required environment by installing Python, Django, and necessary libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas).

3.Train the Random Forest model using a dataset of prediction of migraines to prepare the system for accurate predictions.

4.Run the Django server and access the web interface to begin detecting network intrusions based on user input.
